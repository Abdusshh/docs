- Enhance the Upstash Workflow SDK to expose and configure all QStash features:
    - Ordered queues
    - Parallelism limits
    - Native LLM calls
    - Configure (step-level) retry limit (currently it's only possible to set retry for all steps at once)
- Expand language support with additional SDKs: Python and other languages based on user requests.
- Introduce events to trigger multiple endpoints
- Local development environment for testing
- Endpoint for checking the status & progress of a workflow run
- Running in Vercel Preview: Currently it's not possible to run a workflow in Vercel Preview unless authentication
is disabled.
