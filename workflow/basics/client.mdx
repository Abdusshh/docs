title: "Workflow Client"
---

Workflow client allows you to interact with your workflow runs. Currently, it has three basic functionality:
- [cancel a running workflow run](/workflow/howto/cancel)
- notify a workflow run [waiting for an event](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent)
- get workflow runs waiting for some event

We are planning to add more functionality in the future. See [the roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for more details.

### Trigger Workflow

Using the `trigger` method, you can start a workflow run and get it's run id.

```ts
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://workflow-endpoint.com",
  body: "hello there!",         // optional body
  headers: { ... },             // optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // optional workflow run id
  retries: 3                    // optional retries in the initial request
})

console.log(workflowRunId)
// prints wfr_my-workflow
```

If `workflowRunId` parameter isn't passed, a run id will be generated randomly. If `workflowRunId` is passed, `wfr_` prefix will be added to it.

For other alternatives of starting a workflow, see the [documentation on starting a workflow run](/workflow/howto/start).

### Cancel Workflow

To cancel a workflow, simply use the `cancel` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
await client.cancel({ workflowRunId: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" })
```

### Notify Waiting Workflow

To notify a workflow waiting for an event, you can use the `notify` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
await client.notify({
  eventId: "my-event-id",
  eventData: "my-data" // data passed to the workflow run
});
```

The data passed in `eventData` will be available to the workflow run in the
[`eventData` field of the `context.waitForEvent` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent).

### Get Waiters of Event

To get the list of waiters for some event id, you can use the `getWaiters` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const result = await client.getWaiters({
  eventId: "my-event-id"
})
```

Result will be a list of `Waiter` objects:
