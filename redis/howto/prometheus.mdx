## **Step 1: Log in to Your Upstash Account**

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/).
2. Navigate to the main dashboard, where youâ€™ll see a list of your databases.

## **Step 2: Select your Database**

1. Choose the specific database you wish to integrate with Prometheus.
2. This will open the database settings, where you can manage various configuration options for your selected database.

3. Click the "Enable Prometheus" button. Enabling this will allow you to monitor metrics related to your Upstash database performance, usage, and other key metrics.

## **Step 3: Connect Accounts**

1. Once the Prometheus integration is enabled, a monitoring token will be generated and displayed.

2. Copy this token. This token is unique to your database and is required to authenticate Prometheus with the Upstash metrics endpoint.

## **Step 4: Configure Prometheus to Scrape Upstash Metrics**

1. Open your Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml) and add a new scrape job for Upstash.
2. In this job, include the URL for the Upstash metrics endpoint and add the monitoring token as part of the scrape configuration.

Example configuration;

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'upstash'
    scrape_interval: 1m  # Adjust the interval as needed
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scheme: 'https'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api.upstash.com/monitoring/prometheus']  # Replace with Upstash endpoint
    authorization:
      credentials: 'your-monitoring-token'  # Replace with your monitoring token
```

3. Save the configuration file and reload Prometheus to apply the changes. Prometheus should now start scraping metrics from Upstash at the specified interval.

## **Step 5: Wait for Metrics Availability**

To visualize your Upstash metrics, you can use a pre-built Grafana dashboard.

Select your Prometheus data source when prompted, and complete the import.
