You can enable auto scaling for your database. When your database hits the quotas of your current plan your database will be automatically upgraded to an upper plan without waiting for your confirmation. The upgrades do not cause any downtime. Once the upgrade is completed you will receive an informational email.

Upgrades are triggered when one of the below quotas is exceeded multiple times in a predefined period.
- Max Commands Per Second
- Max Concurrent Connections
- Max Data Size
- Max Daily Bandwidth
- Max Memory Storage
- Max Monthly Usage Cap

You can enable auto scale while creating your database or from the database details page for an existing database.
