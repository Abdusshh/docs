Upstash, by default, will reject writes when the max data size limit has been reached. If you use your database as a cache, 
you can enable eviction to let old data to be removed when max size limit is reached.

- You can enable eviction by checking **Eviction** checkbox while creating a new database:

    <img class="ss" src="/img/eviction/create-database.png" width="520"/>

- Or for an existing database by clicking **Enable** in Configuration/Eviction box in the database details page:

    <img class="ss" src="/img/eviction/configuration.png" width="100%" />


Upstash currently uses a single eviction algorithm, called **optimistic-volatile**, which is a combination of _volatile-random_ and _allkeys-random_
eviction policies available in [the original Redis](https://redis.io/docs/manual/eviction/#eviction-policies).

Initially, keys with expire field (keys marked with a TTL) will be sampled randomly for eviction. In the absence of volatile keys 
or if selected volatile keys are not enough, then some additional non-volatile keys will be chosen randomly for eviction.
We plan to implement more eviction policies in the upcoming releases.
