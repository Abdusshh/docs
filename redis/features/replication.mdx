Replication is enabled for all paid Upstash databases. The data is replicated to multiple instances. Replication provides you high availability and better scalability.


### High Availability

Replication makes your database resilient to failures because even on of the replicas is not available, your database continues to work.


### Better Scalability

In a replicated database, your requests are being distributed among the replicas in a round robin fashion. New replicas are added to the cluster to meet your high throughput needs.


### Architecture

We use the single leader replication model. Each key is owned by a leader replica and other replicas become the backups of the leader. Writes on a key are processed by the leader replica first then propagated to backup replicas. Reads can be performed from any replica. This model gives a better write consistency and read scalability.

Each replica employs a failure detector to track liveness of the leader replica. When the leader replica fails for a reason, remaining replicas start a new leader election round and elect a new leader. This is the only unavailability window for the cluster where your requests can be blocked for a short period of time.

### Consistency

Write requests return after the leader replica processes the operation. Write operations are replicated to backup replicas asynchronously. Read requests can be served by any replica, which gives better horizontal scalability but also means a read request may return a stale value while a write operation for the same key is being propagated to backup replicas.
