### Global Database vs Edge Caching

Both Global database and Edge caching help to minimize the global latency so both are good fits to edge computing use cases. The below are the differences to help you decide which one to use and when.
            
- Edge caching caches the REST responses. Edge caching is possible only with the REST API. Global database supports both Redis clients and REST API. So use Global database if you are working with Redis clients.
                                                                                                    
- Global database replicates your data to 5 regions. Edge caching caches your data to many more CDN locations. So if your clients are located heavily at edge locations which are not covered by 5 regions then Edge caching will give you better read latencies. You can enable Edge caching on a Global database to cover all locations.

- With Global database, all reads will be fetched from the nearest region. With Edge caching, the first read will be get from the origin, the following reads will be fetched from the Edge cache.

- Edge caching invalidates the cached data with a timeout (TTL) which is 30 seconds. So there is a window where your clients will read stale data until the cache is invalidated. Global database replicates the updates instantly to all replicas so data consistency is much better.

- Both global database and edge caching are optimized for read heavy use cases. If your use case is write heavy (90% write) then it makes more sense to use a regional database instead of global database or edge caching.

- You can use Global Database together with Edge Caching. If you want to minimize the read latency in all locations  then enabling edge caching on a Global database is a good solution. Without the global database, edge caching will fetch the first requests from origin with higher latency.
