title: Methods
---

This page contains information on what methods are available in Ratelimit and how they can be used. For information on the
cost of these operations in term of number of Redis commands, refer to the [Costs page](https://upstash.com/docs/oss/sdks/ts/ratelimit/costs).

## `limit`

The `limit` method is the heart of the Ratelimit algorithm.

```ts
ratelimit.limit(
  identifier: string,
  req?: { geo?: Geo; rate?: number },
): Promise<RatelimitResponse> 
```

It receives an identifier to rate limit. Additionally, it can be passed a `req` parameter which can contain either a
`geo` or a `rate` field. `geo` field is passed to the analytics but is not in use currenlty. The `rate` field determines
the amount of tokens/requests to subtract from the state of the algorithm with regards to the provided identifier.

## `blockUntilReady`

In case you don't want to reject a request immediately but wait until it can be
processed, we also provide

```ts
ratelimit.blockUntilReady(
  identifier: string,
  timeout: number
): Promise<RatelimitResponse>
```

It is very similar to the `limit` method and takes an identifier and returns the
same response. However if the current limit has already been exceeded, it will
automatically wait until the next window starts and will try again. Setting the
timeout parameter (in milliseconds) will cause the returned Promise to resolve
in a finite amount of time.

```ts
// Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"),
  analytics: true,
});

// `blockUntilReady` returns a promise that resolves as soon as the request is allowed to be processed, or after 30 seconds
const { success } = await ratelimit.blockUntilReady("id", 30_000);

if (!success) {
  return "Unable to process, even after 30 seconds";
}
doExpensiveCalculation();
return "Here you go!";
```

<Warning>In **Cloudflare**, `blockUntilReady` will not work as intended due to `Date.now()` not behaving the same as in Node environments.<br/><br/>**For more information, check**: <br/>https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-standards</Warning>

## `resetUsedTokens`

This method resets the state of the algorithm with respect to some identifier:

```ts
ratelimit.resetUsedTokens(identifier: string): Promise<void>
```

## `getRemaining`

This method returns the remaining tokens/requests available for some identifier:

```ts
ratelimit.getRemaining(identifier: string): Promise<number>
```
