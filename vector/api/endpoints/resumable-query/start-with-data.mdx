## Request

<ParamField body="data" type="string" required>
  The text data to be embedded and used for querying.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="topK" type="number" default="10">
  The total number of the vectors that you want to receive as a query result.
  The response will be sorted based on the distance metric score, and at most
  `topK` many vectors will be returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="includeMetadata" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether to include the metadata of the vectors in the response, if any. It is
  recommended to set this to `true` to easily identify vectors.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="includeVectors" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether to include the vector values in the response. It is recommended to set
  this to `false` as the vector values can be quite big, and not needed most of
  the time.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="includeData" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether to include the data of the vectors in the response, if any.
</ParamField>

  The namespace to use. When no namespace is specified, the default namespace
  will be used.

## Response

Same as Resumable Query.
