title: Embedding Models
---

Upstash Vector allows you to upsert and query raw text data by handling the
process of embedding them into vectors automatically.

## Models

Upstash Vector comes with variety of embedding models that perform well in the
[MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) leaderboard to support wide
array of use cases such as classification, clustering, and retrieval.

Right now, we support the following general purpose models with different sizes:

| Name | Dimension | Sequence Length |
| ---- | --------- | --------------- |
| [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | 384 | 256 |
| [BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) | 384 | 512 |
| [BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) | 768 | 512 |
| [BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) | 1024 | 512 |
| [WhereIsAI/UAE-Large-V1](https://huggingface.co/WhereIsAI/UAE-Large-V1) | 1024 | 512 |
| [mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) | 1024 | 512 |

<Note>
  The sequence length is not a hard limit. Models truncate the input appropriately when given
  a raw text data that would result in more tokens than the given sequence length. However,
  we recommend using appropriate models and not exceeding their sequence length to have
  more accurate results.
</Note>

## Using Models

To start using embedding models, you need to create the index with a model choice of yours.

</Frame>

Then, you can start upserting and querying raw text data without an extra setup.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
-d '{"id": "1", "data": "Upstash is a serverless data platform.", "metadata": {"metadata_field": "metadata_value"}}' \
https://UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/upsert-data
```

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
-d '{"data": "What is Upstash?", "topK": 1, "includeMetadata": "true"}' \
https://UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/query-data
```
