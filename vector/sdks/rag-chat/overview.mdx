Getting started is this simple:

```ts
import { RAGChat } from "@upstash/rag-chat"

const ragChat = new RAGChat()

// native support for adding PDFs, websites by URL and more
await ragChat.context.add(
  "Quantum JavaScript (Q.js) is a framework for writing quantum algorithms in JavaScript syntax."
)

const response = await ragChat.chat("Tell me about Quantum Javascript")
```
