Upstash has Pro and Enterprise plans for customers with high-volume or critical production workloads. Pro/Enterprise plans have higher capacity limits and more powerful resources for high performance and high availability. They also include additional monitoring and security features.

Pro plans are per database, not per account. You can have databases on different plans in the same account and each is charged separately. Meanwhile, Enterprise plans are per account, not per database. All of your databases can be included in the same Enterprise plan, and they are charged together.

Different than pay-as-you-go plan, Pro and Enterprise plans have fixed pricing.

## Pro Features
These features are available on Pro databases but are not included in the pay-as-you-go plan.

### Uptime SLA
All Pro databases come with an SLA guaranteeing 99.99% uptime. For mission-critical data where uptime is crucial, we recommend Pro plans.

### RBAC
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that manages database access. You can create multiple users with different roles to control their actions on your databases.

We recommend using RBAC if your database is accessible to multiple developers.

### SOC-2 Type 2 Report
We have a SOC 2 Type 2 report available for our Pro and Enterprise plans. You can request access to the report by contacting [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).

### Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system widely used for monitoring and alerting in cloud-native and containerized environments.

Upstash Pro and Enterprise plans offer Prometheus metrics collection, enabling you to monitor your Redis databases with Prometheus in addition to console metrics.

### Datadog Integration

Upstash Pro and Enterprise plans include integration with Datadog, allowing you to monitor your Redis databases with Datadog in addition to console metrics.


## Enterprise Features

All Pro features can be included in the Enterprise plan upon request. Additionally, Enterprise plans include:

### Professional Support
All of the databases in the Enterprise plan get access to our professional support. The plan includes response time SLAs and priority access to our support team. Check out the [support page](https://upstash.com/docs/common/help/prosupport) for more details.


The below features are available upon request for Enterprise customers.

### SSO
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows you to use your existing identity provider to authenticate users for your Upstash account. This feature is available upon request for Enterprise customers.

### VPC Peering and Private Links
VPC Peering and Private Links enable you to connect your databases to your VPCs and other private networks, enhancing isolation and security while reducing data transfer costs. This feature is available upon request for Enterprise customers.


### Configurable Backups
Hourly backups with customizable retention are available upon request for Enterprise customers.

### Access Logs
Enterprise customers can request access logs to the databases.

### More Resources
A non-Enterprise Upstash account can create up to 100 databases and 10 teams. Enterprise customers can request more resources.

### HIPAA Compliance
HIPAA reports are available with our Enterprise plans, along with the SOC 2 Type 2 report. To request access, please contact [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).

<Note>
    Pro plans are per database (not per account). You can have
    databases on different plans in the same account and each is charged
    separately. Pro plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards
    you can cancel any time.
</Note>

## How to Upgrade

You can upgrade your database to a Pro plan on the database details page in the console. For the Enterprise plan, contact [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).

## Network & Storage Costs

In Pro plans, in addition to plan price, you will be charged for
storage and network usage costs.

<Note>
    You can enable VPC Peering to minimize data transfer cost. Contact us
    [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

Storage Cost Storage cost calculation is the same as pay-as-you-go plan which
`$0.25 per GB-month`. The total cost is determined by adding up the storage at all
replica and regions.

Network (data transfer) cost is `$0.03 per GB` for databases. For use cases with high volume, you
may consider VPC Peering which minimizes the data transfer cost.

<Note>
    The above pricing assumes that the clients and database are in the same cloud
    provider. If not, you may be charged at a higher rate proportional to what
    cloud providers charge us. Contact us
    [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
