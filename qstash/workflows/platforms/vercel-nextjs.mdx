To define a workflow endpoint in a Next.js project,
you can define a POST endpoint like this:

```javascript
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";

export const POST = serve<string>(
  async context => {
    // ...
  },
)
```

For more examples, see [the workflow Next.js example](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/examples/workflow/nextjs). If you wish to run the example localy, you can refer to [the local development section](/qstash/workflows/howto/local-development) or [the README in the workflow examples directory](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/examples/workflow).
