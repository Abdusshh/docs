This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflows with Next.js.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Install the QStash SDK

First, install the QStash SDK in your Next.js project:

```bash
npm install @upstash/qstash
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This token is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash
touch .env.local
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token:

```bash .env.local
QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:

## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint

A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.

To define a workflow endpoint in a Next.js project, navigate into the Next.js `app/api` directory and create a new folder, for example called `workflow`. Inside this folder, create a `route.ts` file that contains your workflow:

```typescript app/api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs"

export const POST = serve(
  async (context) => {
    await context.run("initial-step", async () => {
      console.log("initial step ran")
    })

    await context.run("second-step", async () => {
      console.log("second step ran")
    })
  },
  {
    // A live URL is required to run a workflow locally,
    // see step 4 for details
    baseUrl:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
        ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
        : undefined,
  }
)
```

Currently, all workflow steps must be an asynchronous function. We are working on adding support for synchronous functions.

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint

For QStash, a tool that's used to run workflows under the hood, you need to provide a live URL for your workflow endpoint. Here's how to [set up your workflow endpoint for local development](qstash/workflows/howto/local-development).

In production, a workflows `baseUrl` is automatically set and can be omitted.

Once you have a live URL for your local workflow endpoint, trigger your workflow by first starting your Next.js app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and then making a POST request to your workflow endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/api/workflow
```

For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:

```bash
{ workflowRunId: "wfr_xxxxxxxx" }
```

This ID can be used to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.

## Step 5: Deploying to Production

When deploying your Next.js application with Upstash Workflows to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN` and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.

2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production:

   ```typescript app/api/workflow/route.ts
   export const POST = serve(
     async (context) => {
       // Your workflow steps
     },
     {
       // Conditionally set in development, but not in production
       // as the baseUrl is automatically set in production
       baseUrl:
         process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
           ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
           : undefined,
     }
   )
   ```

3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Next.js application to Vercel, AWS Amplify or other platforms as you normally would. These platforms will automatically detect and build your Next.js application.

4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://<YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL>/api/workflow
   ```

5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.

6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
