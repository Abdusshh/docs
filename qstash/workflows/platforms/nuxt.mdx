To define a workflow endpoint in a Nuxt project,
you can define a POST endpoint like this:

```javascript
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nuxt";

export default serve<string>(
  async context => {
    // ...
  },
)
```

For more examples, see [the workflow Nuxt example](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/examples/workflow/nuxt). If you wish to run the example localy, you can refer to [the local development section](/qstash/workflows/howto/local-development) or [the README in the workflow examples directory](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/examples/workflow).
