title: "Supported Platforms"

Currently, we have `serve` method implementation in a number of platforms:
- [Vercel](/qstash/workflows/platforms/vercel-nextjs)
- [Cloudflare Workers](/qstash/workflows/platforms/cloudflare-workers)
- [Nuxt](/qstash/workflows/platforms/nuxt)
- [Solidjs](/qstash/workflows/platforms/solidjs)
- [Svelte](/qstash/workflows/platforms/svelte)

If you wish to utilize `serve` in a different platform,
you can do so using the base `serve` method:

```javascript
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/workflow"
```

You can write a platform specific `serve` method using the base one.
If you want to learn more, you can have a look at [the implementation
of the existing platform specific `serve` methods](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/platforms).
