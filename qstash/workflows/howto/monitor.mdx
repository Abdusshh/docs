title: "Monitor Logs"

Logs of the Workflows can be found in the console under the [Workflows tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=workflows)

It has two modes that can be changed from to top right corner: 
- **Grouped By Workflow Run Id** : This is the default view where the overall workflow run is summarized. You can see each step 
, its start date and output and also whether it is succesfully delivered or not. 
- **Flat View** : The flat view is for mostly debugging when a workflow step has failed. It has more detail about individual 
events of each step. 

We have 4 new event types introduced on top of [existing message events](/qstash/howto/debug-logs). Note that message events are relavent for individual steps. 
The new 4 events are to show the state of a workflow run. 

- **RUN_STARTED**
- **RUN_FAILED** 
- **RUN_CANCELLED**
- **RUN_SUCCESS**

TODO SANCAR EXAMPLE SCREEN SHOT.

See [Rest API](/qstash/workflows/rest/events/list) for more details about the endpoint used for this tab.
