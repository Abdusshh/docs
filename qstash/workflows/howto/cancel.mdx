title: "Cancel A  Workflow Run"
---

You can cancel a workflow run both programatically and from console. 

## Console 

From the [Workflows tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=workflows), after finding the related workflow you can cancel the workflow run as follows:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash/qstash-workflows-cancel.png" />
</Frame>



## Programatically

<CodeGroup>
```javascript via workflow context
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";
import { UserRequest} from "../../../lib/util";

export const POST = serve<UserRequest>(
  routeFunction: async (context) => {
    const input = context.requestPayload;

    await context.qstashClient.workflow.cancel("workflowRunId")
  },
);
```
 
```javascript over qstashClient
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

await client.workflow.cancel("wf_id")
```
</CodeGroup>


Also you can use [Rest API](/qstash/workflows/rest/runs/cancel) to cancel a workflow run.
