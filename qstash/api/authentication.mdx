You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the QStash API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Bearer Token

When making requests to QStash, you will need your `QSTASH_TOKEN` â€” you will find it in the [console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash). Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash
curl https://qstash.upstash.com/v2/publish/... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
