title: "Cancel a run"
---

You can cancel a running workflow both programatically and from your Upstash Workflow console. 

## Cancelling via console 

In your Upstash Workflow console, find the run you'd like to cancel and press the `Cancel Workflow` button on the right side:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/cancel_workflow.png" />
</Frame>

## Cancelling programatically

```javascript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";

export const POST = serve(
  async (context) => {
    // ðŸ‘‡ cancel a running workflow
    await context.qstashClient.workflow.cancel("<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>")
  },
);
```

And replace `<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>` with your actual run ID. You can also use the [Upstash Workflow REST API](/qstash/workflow/rest/runs/cancel) to cancel a run programatically.
