On this page, we explain how to use Upstash Workflow with Hono.

You can find [a complete Hono example in the sdk repository](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/examples/workflow/hono). You can also find [a Cloudflare Worker example using Hono router](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/tree/main/examples/workflow/cloudflare-workers-hono) under our examples.

# 1. Setting up Your Project

First, you should start a project. You can learn more about [starting a Hono project in Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/basic).

Once you initialize the project, you should run the following command to install QStash:

```
npm i @upstash/qstash
```

# 2. Local Development

To be able to run a workflow in a local project, you will need to start a local tunnel in order for QStash server to communicate with your application. [See the local development section to learn more](/qstash/workflow/howto/local-development).

# 3. Environment Variables

Until now, we have only set the `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` environment variable. Next, we should set the `UPSTASH_TOKEN` environment variable. You can get `UPSTASH_TOKEN` from [the Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/).

Optionally, you can also set `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` environment variables. See ["Secure Endpoints" for more details](/qstash/workflow/howto/security).

# 4. serve method

Next, we will define the `serve` method. Go to the `src/index.ts` file and add the workflow endpoint as:

```javascript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/hono"

const app = new Hono();

app.post("/workflow", serve<{text: string}>(
  async context => {
    // ...
  }
))

export default app
```

See [the documentation of the `serve` method for more details](/qstash/workflow/basics/serve).

# 5. Run Locally

Finally, we can run the project locally. Simply run:

```
npm run dev
```

To trigger the endpoint, you can run:

```
curl -X POST <DEV-URL>/workflow -d '{"text": "hello world!"}'
```

Note that if you set environment variables `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY`; your curl request with fail since the endpoint only accepts requests coming from QStash. [See "Secure Endpoints" for how you can call these endpoints](/qstash/workflow/howto/security).

# 6. deploy
