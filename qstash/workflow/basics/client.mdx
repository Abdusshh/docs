title: "Workflow Client"
---

Workflow client allows you to interact with your workflow runs. Currently, it has three basic functionality:
- [cancel a running workflow run](/qstash/workflow/howto/cancel)
- notify a workflow run [waiting for an event](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent)
- get workflow runs waiting for some event

We are planning to add more functionality in the future. See [the roadmap](/qstash/workflow/roadmap) for more details.

### Cancel Workflow

To cancel a workflow, simply use the `cancel` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
await client.cancel({ workflowRunId: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" })
```

### Notify Waiting Workflow

To notify a workflow waiting for an event, you can use the `notify` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
await client.notify({
  eventId: "my-event-id",
  eventData: "my-data" // data passed to the workflow run
});
```

The data passed in `eventData` will be available to the workflow run in the
[`eventData` field of the `context.waitForEvent` method](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent).

### Get Waiters of Event

To get the list of waiters for some event id, you can use the `getWaiters` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const result = await client.getWaiters({
  eventId: "my-event-id"
})
```

Result will be a list of Waiter objects:

```typescript
type Waiter = {
  url: string;          // url to call upon notify
  deadline: number;     // unix timestamp when the wait will time out
  timeoutUrl: string;   // url to call upon timeout
  timeoutBody: unknown; // body used in timeout request
  headers: Record<string, string[]>;        // headers sent in case of notify
  timeoutHeaders: Record<string, string[]>; // headers sent in case of time out
};
```
