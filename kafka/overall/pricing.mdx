<Info>
  Empty consume messages are free, not included in billing calculations.
</Info>

<Info>
  The above plans are per cluster. When you first create your account without
  entering credit card, your first database will be in Free tier. When you enter
  credit card, your database will be upgraded to pay-as-you-go automatically.
</Info>

## Free Tier

Upstash has a free tier with some limitations. Free tier limits **10K messages
per day** and **max 256Mb retention size**. A user can create max 10 partitions
in the Free tier. When you enter your credit card, your cluster will be upgraded
to pay-as-you-go plan and limits will be removed.
First 10K commands of paid databases will be free too.


You do not need to enter your credit card to use Upstash in Free Tier.

<Tip>
  If you want to try Upstash paid and enterprise plans, we can offer **Free
  Trials**. Email us at support@upstash.com

## Serverless Pricing

Pay-as-you-go pricing model is serverless. You pay for the amount of messages
(Kafka messages) processed by your Kafka cluster. The storage cost is charged
separately. The data transfer is free as long as your usage is under the monthly
bandwidth quota.

```text
100.000 messages cost $0.6 for a multi replica cluster.

Request cost of Cluster = Total message count / 100.000 X $0.6

Storage cost of Cluster (monthly) = Average Data Size (in GB) X $0.25

Total Cost = Request Cost + Storage Cost
```

We take daily average of your data size and multiply with 0.25 at the end of the
month. If you have 1 GB data in your cluster through the all month, you pay
\$0.25 monthly. If your cluster is empty in the first 29 days of the month and it
expands to 30GB on the last day of the month; then still you pay \$0.25 for that
month (30GB / 30day X 0.25).

<Note>
  The total storage is the sum of storage in all replicas. So 1MB message data
  will total up to 3MB in a multi replica cluster.
</Note>

### Max Monthly Budget

With Pay As you go plan, you can set a maximum monthly budget for your cluster so that you won't be charged beyond this chosen limit. We'll keep you informed by sending email notifications once you reach 70% and 90% of your monthly budget. This notifications will let you  either adjust your budget limit or upgrade to the Pro tier. Please note that if your usage exceeds your monthly budget cap, your cluster will be rate limited and your cost will not exceed your chosen budget limit.

## Pay-as-you-go Plan Quotas

_Pay as you go_ plan has soft limits which are introduced to ensure the fair use
of resources among our users. Quotas are soft limits. When your cluster reaches
the quota we do not stop your service, but we will contact you and ask you to
upgrade your service to an upper plan.

<Note>
  Quotas are not technical limits. They can be customized on your request.
  Contact us (support@upstash.com) if you think your application needs higher
  limits.
</Note>

| Limit                   | Value | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Max Messages Per Second | 1000  | This is the number of messages that you can produce/consume per second. |
| Max Message Size        | 1MB  | This is the max size of a single message you can produce.               |
| Max Partitions          | 100   | This is the max total number of partitions you can create in the plan.  |
| Max Monthly Bandwidth     | 1TB | The max data transfer (bandwidth) limit per day.                        |

All limits are per cluster. If you think, your use case will exceed the above
quotas, contact us (support@upstash.com) to update the quotas or check our
[Pro/Enterprise Plans](#pro-enterprise-plans) where the limits are higher.

<Note>
  Topics which are idle (no message is produced or consumed) for more than 1.5
  times max-retention-time will be deleted automatically.
</Note>

<Info>
    The data transfer is free up to monthly bandwidth limit. Beyond that, we charge $0.1 per GB
