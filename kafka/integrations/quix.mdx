[Quix](https://quix.io?utm_source=upstash) is a complete platform for developing, deploying, and monitoring stream processing pipelines. You use the Quix Streams Python library to develop modular stream processing applications, and deploy them to containers managed in Quix with a single click. You can develop and manage applications on the command line or manage them in Quix Cloud and visualize them as a end-to-end pipeline.


## Upstash Kafka Setup

Create a Kafka cluster using
[Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/kafka) or
[Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli) by following
[Getting Started](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka).

## Quix Setup

Like Upstash, Quix is a managed serviceâ€”this means that you don't need to provision any servers or compute resources. You can [register for a free trial account](https://portal.platform.quix.io/self-sign-up/) and started in minutes. 


# Configure the broker settings

When you [create your first project](https://quix.io/docs/create/create-project.html) in Quix, you'll be asked to configure a message broker. You have the option to configure an external broker (instead the default Quix managed broker).

To use Upstash as your message broker, select the Upstash option and configure the settings shown in the following screenshot:

## Create your first pipeline

To help you get started, the Quix platform includes several pipeline templates that you can deploy in a few clicks.  

To test the Upstash connection, you can use the ["Hello Quix" template](https://quix.io/templates/hello-quix) which is a simple three-step pipeline:

</Frame>


* Click [**Clone this project** ](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?projectName=Hello%20Quix&httpsUrl=https://github.com/quixio/template-hello-quix&branchName=tutorial).
* On the **Import Project** screen, select **Quix advanced configuration**  (this option ensures that you'll get the option to configure own broker settings).
* Follow the project creation wizard and configure your Upstash connection details when prompted.
* Click **Sync your pipeline**


## Test the Setup

In the Quix portal, wait for the services to deploy and show up as "Running".

Check that the required topics ("_csv-data_" and "_counted-names_") show up in both Quix and Upstash. In Upstash, topics that originate from Quix show up with the Quix workspace and project name as a prefix (e.g. "_quixdemo-helloquix-csv-data_").
