[Timeplus](https://timeplus.com) is a streaming-first data analytics platform. It provides powerful end-to-end capabilities, leveraging the open source streaming engine [Proton](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton), to help teams process streaming and historical data quickly and intuitively, accessible for organizations of all sizes and industries. It enables data engineers and platform engineers to unlock streaming data value using SQL.

## Upstash Kafka Setup

Create a Kafka cluster using [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) or [Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli) by following [Getting Started](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka).

Create two topics by following the creating topic [steps](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka#create-a-topic). Letâ€™s name the first topic `input`, since we are going to stream from this topic to Timeplus. The name of the second topic can be `output`. This one is going to receive the stream from Timeplus.

## Create a Kafka Source in Timeplus

Besides the Open Source engine [Proton](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton), Timeplus also offers Timeplus Cloud, a fully managed cloud service with SOC2 Type 1 Security Compliance.

To use the Timeplus Cloud, [create an account](https://us.timeplus.cloud) and setup a new workspace.

After creating the workspace, click the `Data Ingestion` in the menu bar. Click on `Add Data`

<Frame>

</Frame>

Choose the `Apache Kafka` source.
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/timeplus/1-choose-kafka-source.png" />
</Frame>

In the wizard, specify the Kafka Brokers as `<name>-<region>-kafka.upstash.io:9092`. Enable all security options and choose `SASL SCRAM 256` and type the username and password.
<Frame>

</Frame>

Click the `Next` button. In the dropdown list, you should be able to see all available Kafka topics. Choose the `input` topic. Leave the `JSON` as the `Read As` option. Choose `Earliest` if you already create messages in the topic. Otherwise use the default value `Latest`.

</Frame>

Click the `Next` button, it will start loading messages in the `input` topic. 

Let's go to Upstash UI and post a JSON message in `input` topic:

```json
{
  "requestedUrl": "http://www.internationalinteractive.name/end-to-end",
  "method": "PUT",
  "ipAddress": "186.58.241.7",
  "requestDuration": 678
}
```
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/timeplus/post-message.png" />
</Frame>
Right after the message is posted, you should be able to see it in the Timeplus UI. Since you specify JSON format, those 4 key/value pairs are read as 4 columns. Choose a name for the data stream, say `input` and accept the default options.
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/timeplus/3-source-step-preview.png" />
</Frame>
Click the `Next` button to review the settings. Finally, click the `Create the source` button.
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/timeplus/4-source-step-4.png" />
</Frame>
There will be a green notification message informing you the source has been created.

## Run Streaming SQL

Click the `Query` menu on the left and type the streaming SQL as:
```sql
select * from input
```
Go back to the Upstash UI to post a few more messages to the topic and you can see those live events in the query result.

</Frame>

## Apply Streaming ETL and Write Data to Upstash Kafka
Cancel the previous streaming SQL and use the following one to mask the IP addresses.
```sql
select now64() AS time, requestedUrl,method,lower(hex(md5(ipAddress))) AS ip
from input where _tp_time > earliest_ts()
```
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/timeplus/streaming-etl-sql.png" />
</Frame>

Click the `Send as Sink` button. Use the default `Kafka` output type and specify the broker, topic name(`output`), user name and password.
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/timeplus/create-sink.png" />
</Frame>

Click the `Send` button to create the sink.

Go back to the Upstash UI. Create a few more messages in `input` topic and you should get them available in `output` topic with raw IP addresses masked.
